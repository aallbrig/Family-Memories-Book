<h4 class="center-text"><u>Anecdote: The Mask</u></h4>

The choir at a United Methodist church was in practice near Halloween time. A little four-year-old grandson of a member of the was having fun running up and down the aisles of the church with a Halloween mask on.

Finally, his grandmother reproached him. “Luke, Jesus would not like for you to run in His Church.”

“But grandmother,” Luke says, “Jesus does not know who I am with this mask on.”

<h4 class="center-text"><u>An Autumn Afternoon</u></h4>

<div class="preformatted">
Note:   The following article has been written, not only out of love and admiration for Mrs. Allbright, but in search of some answers pertaining to all of us to the longevity of too few of our lives.  She will turn 101 November 29, 1983.  In this nuclear, polluted environmental age, one cannot help but ponder the reasons why there are those persons who survive cancer, heart disease, mental and physical breakdown plus other numerous ailments.  Mrs. Allbright appears to have survived them all.  With so much emphasis on aerobics, vitamins, cholesterol, polysaturates, additives, etc., it is confusing to think that this lady probably does not know the meaning of such words.  In no way do we advocate that, in our society, we must not be aware of the importance of their meaning because the manner in which most of us live today is radically different from hers; it is that difference that deserves some exploration.

We share this very special afternoon with hoping you might find some clues for your own good well-being.  If not, then just enjoy this visit with us.  Our only regret is that we do not have our conversation recorded for all of the family to hear.  We will remember this afternoon the remaining days of our lives as it is rare for Mr. Allbright to reminisce and philosophy on such a broad scope.  She is by nature shyly reluctant to impose her viewpoints or beliefs.

On that day, she imparted many things that no one had ever heard her speak of before, and perhaps never again.  She does not hesitate to tell anyone that she cannot do all the things she would like to do.  That is difficult to not move at the active pace she was accustomed to and that she does not see as well as she would like.  All who know her marvel at her mentality.  There are minute signs now and then of senility.

She is up every morning, dressed when she comes to the table to eat breakfast with her son, Kenneth, and his wife Margie.  The three of them reside on the farm near Shoals, that Mr. and Mrs. Allbright bought when they were married at the turn of the century.

She was born to Isaac Harrison and Amanda Nugent Smith near Huron.  She is the last surviving member of her family which included brothers, Edward and Charles and sisters, Nelia and Aminda.  Mr. Allbright has one surviving brother, Orville, whose farm adjoins Mrs. Allbright’s.  Her life has revolved around her five children, Elmer, who dies this summer, Lucille Summers, Homer, Kenneth, and Wilma Ray.  The dedication that Kenneth and Margie have for his is incomprehensible.  This dedication expresses itself everywhere around the farm.  To go there, one feels as cleansed and refreshed as a spring rain.  Come spend this afternoon with us now.


Dear Mom,

You have accomplished on this day something that is very rare.  To reach one hundred one years and be a lovely and alert as you are, is, indeed, a blessing from God.

To look back on the years that I have been in the family (over 50) has been a pleasure, and much of it has been because of you.  Know that in all the things I did and many people that I have associated with, if there are disappointments, there’s always Mom at home to look to.  You were always there.

I remember the Sundays and other days that we spent with you, the tasty dinners that you would cook and the cheerful attitude that you had in serving them.  I remember that wonderful homemade cottage cheese that you had, and the good time that you had attending and milking the cows.  Your green beans were always better than anyone else’s.  The jellies that you made and always generous to share will never be forgotten.  The rows of fruits and vegetables that you preserved in the summer were your pride and joy.  It was a reward of your labor, and rightfully so.

I remember many things about you Mom.  I know that you say that you wish you could do more now, but just remember that you are doing a lot by just being here with us.

We are thankful for Kenny and Margie and for the care that they give to you.  You are lucky to have them.

I am praying every day for changes in making things more pleasant for you.  If I have been the cause of any dissention, I am sorry.  With a change of attitudes and God’s help I am sure things will be better.  We do not want you to worry about that.

--Maggie Toliver Allbright

<h4 class="center-text"><u>James Frederick Summers</u></h4>
<div class="center-text">March 1, 1900 – 1977</div>
<div class="preformatted">
James Frederick Summers, known by family, friends and acquaintances as Chip, Chippy or Che Che, was born in Martin County, March 1, 1900.  He was one of eight children born to Effie Pruett and Richard Summers.

Last Tuesday, March 1, 1977, marked his 77th birthday.  Or God saw fit to let him remain with his loved ones eight more glorious days, allowing him to return from Bloomington hospital for one more visit.

The harsh, bitterly cold winter of 1977 will go down in history for its hardships, inconveniences and devastation.  Yes, it took its toll and is still making demands.  It will live in the hearts of Lucille (Chippy would want us to call her “Ceal”), his daughter, Margie, and his grandson Gary as the year PaPaw left them behind.

Found amid the losses of 1977 are many treasured souvenirs Ceal shares with us.  Hours, days and weeks of the two of them literally snowbound in their home on Prospect Hill overlooking Springs Valley.  So near to the main road – yet so far – as their driveway, their car and their home were enveloped by mountains of snow.  Food and mail were delivered on foot.

Thank God for that snow!  Ceal and Chip shared a last togetherness too often never experienced by husband and wife during a lifetime in the hectic mode of life of our present generation.

What kind of man was James Frederick Summers?  Each of us form various impressions of others.  Those who knew him best agree he loved and lived in every sense of the meaning of loving and living.

In a large city some of Chip’s so-called escapades would go by unnoticed.  In a small town like Shoals, they were sometimes sensational.  In his younger days, he was probably known as “wild.”  Our older generation knows the definition of that word.  By today’s standards where terrorists, rapists, murderers, and dope-pushers reign, one would barely label a person like Chippy “wild.”

He enjoyed an all-night poker game at one of the local saloons with “the boys.”  He liked a drink of good whiskey, sometimes a little more than his share.  He loved to dance and could really step off of fancy jig.  He was a square-dance “caller” and a terrific one.  He enjoyed baseball, serving as an umpire at local games.  Baseball remained his favorite sport.  He knew good-looking clothes and was quite a dapper gentlemen-about-tow, having a keen eye for the pretty girls.  He finally found one and kept her by his side ever after.  A serious man, too, with more than his share of ability and knowledge.

People of Shoals will associate Chippy with the Pearl Button Factory.  One of its kind and a science that doesn’t exist any ore.

He will be remembered for his kindness to others, his laughter, his keen sense of humor, his hospitality when someone came to his home, but most of all for his extreme generosity.

Chippy did not acquire an abundance of material wealth.  He gave most of everything away willingly and happily.  If friends or family needed anything and Chip could lend a helping hand, he was always there.

He will be sadly missed.  Time will not heal the wounds but it will make them easier to bear.

He is survived not only by his wife Ceal, his daughter Margie, and his grandson Gary, but two brothers, Richard Edmund (Eddie) and Aaron Thomas, one sister, Agnes Leona Allegree, and by a multitude of nieces, nephews and relatives who will never forget “Chip.”

<h4 class="center-text"><u>Autumn Visit</u></h4>
<div class="preformatted">
It was one of those brilliant, blue-skied Indiana afternoons in October, Round the last curve on the road that takes us “home,” the panoramic vista of a farm nestled among oaks, maples, walnuts and hills extends a greeting of immense pride.  Nothing seems to lack attention from the newly painted white trim on the old red bard, to the fence rows standing ever so erectly, to the white house gleaming on an immaculately manicured lawn, one will find no litter or clutter here.  Even the antiquated store building, once a scene of bustling activity, emerges ever so proudly reminding us of a bygone era of horses, buggies, Model T’s and the many customers who traded their wares at this “general store.”

Wasn’t it only yesterday when we were last home to visit that new green corn stalks were pushing their way from the ground bespeaking of a bountiful harvest to be reaped?  These once green stalks lay withered and dried on the ground now, prematurely aged from the onslaught of the summer drought.  Some corn has been salvaged, we could see the ears and the silks poking out of the crib slats.

Cords of neatly stacked firewood made us realize another winter was upon us.  Someone’s unrelenting efforts would provide warmth for those inside.  Pumpkins, squashes and turnips were being gathered and lay amid the purple, white and pink petunias and geraniums still blooming in all their glory as if they were bidding hello to summer rather than farewell.

Stepping from the car, a caressing warm breeze feathered by a hint of the crispness of autumn touched our faces.  Foliage on the trees was a vivid assortment of colors.  Some of the leaves were still green clinging with a courageous grip unwilling to let go of their spring and summer.  Others were waving their kaleidoscopic splendor of yellows, oranges, golds, rusts and reds while others were caught in the wind twirling and floating in space before falling to the ground to take their places in the sequence of nature.

The purple Martin, so anxiously awaited in the spring had left their white and green roofed homes in search of spring in a distant land.  We longingly hope to see their return announcing another year and another spring to share.  We pray silently that the Martins that return will find things as they left them.

Entering the doorway to a sparkling white and blue kitchen were familiar smells of a freshly baked persimmon pudding, a gooseberry pie, and angelhood cake mingling with aromas of green beans (late-comers from the garden) cooking on the stove along with tomato preserves and a pickle relish simmering.

The focal point in the kitchen is Mrs. Allbright better known as “Mom.”  We all call her that.  She is sitting there now a magnificent, proud lady greeting us with open arms.  The kitchen scene is much the same as always except that Margie is now in command where Mom reigned supreme such a short time ago.  It touches our hearts to see Margie carrying on in Mom’s footsteps, doing chores like Mom did them.

It is in awe we look at Mom.  We see the look of Winter upon her but we also see the freshness of Springtime on her soft face.  Is there a hidden secret she has or what is the answer to the riddle that propels her?  Is the answer a complicated or simple one?  Is it the food she eats, the air she breathes, the water she drinks, her attitude or a combination of all these??  She really doesn’t know.  Without hesitation, she emphatically states that she is still here because there is something else, she must get done.

After a cup of tea, she begins to speak about the things she has done.  How she loved to sing and ride her horse called “Fancy” with her sister Mindy.  She could have become a professional singer, but she got married instead.  Did she regret that?  Why no, she wouldn’t let herself think about that.  She did other things like singing with Deck, Orville and Lucille at church and social gatherings.  She talked of Neely who was just the opposite of Mindy.  Mindy was all fun and could play any instrument by ear, while Neely was quiet and remote always concerned about her looks.  Mindy made her the beautiful white dress trimmed in blue satin that she wore when she and Deck were married.  She wished no one knew how old she was.  “Why, a woman will tell her age will tell anything.”  She doesn’t know how the word got out but it is hard for her to believe she is as old and “they” say.  Would she want to live her life over again and what would she do differently if she could?  Yes, she replied, “I would like to live my life over to have all my children babies once more.”  For what she would do differently, she would try to be much wiser than she is now to be able to answer so many problems that people have.

Her mind was travelling from thought to thought, from past to present to future.  She went on telling us about home.  It was just a wilderness when Deck bought it.  He built the house first then the store.  He house was only to be temporary as Deck was going to build her a mansion.  She smiles with amusement, explaining that he became too busy with the store and farm.

Yes, she worked hard taking care of her children and every summer cooking, for workhands, sometimes as many as 30 when the thrashers came.  She would cook fried chicken and all the trimmings.  They loved to come to the Allbrights to eat.  When salesmen came to the store, Deck would bring them to eat and they would use their best linens and dishes just like they did when they had company.

Deck would never let her work outside.  When she went out, she always wore long gloves above the elbow and a bonnet to keep her face and arms from the hot sun.  It wasn’t fashionable to be tan back then.

Her mother was an orphan and she didn’t know much about her.  Her Dad fought in the battle at Gettysburg.  This summer has been hard, she explains with a look of sadness, she lost one of her children and she never would have thought she would outlive one of them.  And, Homer lost his arm in that horrible corn picker accident a few years ago.  She wished she could give him one of her arms.

She says she tries to think of pleasant things and be grateful for what she has.  She is grateful that she is able to stay in her home and have Kenny and Margie with her.  She would like for all her children to live at home.  She tells us how Kenny will do anything for her and Margie treats her like a baby.

Does she believe in life after death?  She has no comment to make on this.  When asked what she has yet to do, she replies that she wants to see more love shown for each other.  That in her Bible she has put a message for her children to live by that says, “Love one another as I have loved You.”  That is what I want to see fulfilled.  That is all I ask of life now.

We dare to look at each other, Donna and I.  Down our faces, tears are streaming.  Mom can’t see us.  She wouldn’t want us to cry over something she said.  We are mesmerized by this woman and we feel the aura of grandeur about her.  From what source does this wisdom and this well of life flow?  Without seeing eyes, she envisions all the wonders and beauty of life in her heart.  Faith lives on within her – unyielding.  Is this the answer?

(Autumn Visit was with Wilma Ray and Donna Allbright Allen, grand-daughter, Oct.11, ’83)
